        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a first-year master's student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics 
            at TSE. I'm passionate about combining mathematics, statistics, and 
            cutting-edge artificial intelligence. My academic focus revolves around 
            deep learning, particularly in image processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond theory, I'm a dedicated coder. I constantly explore new AI algorithms 
            and techniques, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable. This journey has 
            honed my technical skills and deepened my appreciation for applying 
            mathematical concepts in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my projects, I blend robust statistics with innovative AI to uncover
            valuable insights. My aim is to contribute to AI by leveraging my strong
            math foundation, using algorithms to solve complex problems and drive
            transformative technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            This portfolio showcases my journey, highlighting projects that demonstrate
            my skills and passion. It reflects my academic pursuits and reveals my 
            aspirations in the exciting field of AI and applied mathematics.

                <strong>Contribution to 
                <a href="https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN">joliGEN</a></strong>: 
                 I implemented a range of advanced edge detection methods to 
                 significantly enhance the capabilities and usability of the 
                 open-source tool joliGEN. This included incorporating image generation
                 controls (from the ControlNET paper) to provide users with greater 
                 flexibility and control over their image generation tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                I implemented state‐of‐the‐art machine learning models such as Owl‐ViT
                for zero‐shot object detection.
            </li>
            <li>I took charge of developing the entire documentation <a href="https://www.joligen.com/doc/">website</a> for the 
                tool, using ReadTheDocs. This involved creating a user-friendly, 
                comprehensive resource that enabled users to quickly understand and
                utilize the tool's features and functionalities, enhancing the overall 
                user experience.</li>

            <li>
                I took ownership of the project from initial requirements gathering to
                final tool delivery, using Agile methodologies for efficient project
                management.
            </li>
            <li>
                I designed an intuitive user interface using R Shiny to facilitate 
                data input and publication generation, enhancing user experience.
