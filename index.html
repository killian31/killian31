        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a first-year master's student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at TSE, I am deeply passionate about the convergence of mathematics, statistics, and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. My academic journey is fueled by a profound appreciation for the elegance and power of deep learning, particularly in the realm of image processing and analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            My enthusiasm extends beyond theoretical understanding into practical application. I am an avid coder, continually exploring new algorithms and techniques to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI. This journey has not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the intricate beauty of mathematical concepts in real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my projects, I strive to blend robust statistical methods with innovative AI approaches, seeking to uncover insights that are both profound and applicable. My goal is to contribute to the field of AI in a way that leverages my strong mathematical foundation, harnessing the power of algorithms to solve complex problems and create transformative technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            This portfolio is a testament to my journey so far, showcasing projects that exemplify my skills and passion. It is both a reflection of my academic pursuits and a window into the future contributions I aspire to make in the exciting world of artificial intelligence and applied mathematics.
